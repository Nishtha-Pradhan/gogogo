This project is created by following the tutorial: <br>
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-contexts-in-go

In this program, we play with the context concept of GoLang and see how its:
- initiated,
- provided with a value,
- signalled to be 'Done',
- given a deadline &
- timeout

This program demonstrates how to handle scenarios where the client server closes before a response can be sent, thereby saving processing costs.

To run this program, use:
```bash
go run context.go
```
