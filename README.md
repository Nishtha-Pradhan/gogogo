# Info

This repository contains basic programs which can act as a starting point when learning GOlang.
As of June 2024, these programs have been updated:
* hello *(the basic hello world program)*
* jsondata *(program to generate & parse json data using map & struct)*
* proxy_json *(creating a proxy server of your own)*
* context_function *(playing with context in go)*

To run these programs, go inside the respective program folder and run them.
Example:

```bash
cd jsondata
go run main.go
```
Most of these are from online tutorials and I have added additional comments for better understanding.

Alright then, you are ready to GoGoGo :grin:
