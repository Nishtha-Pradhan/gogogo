This project is created by following the tutorial:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-json-in-go

In this program, map & struct are to generate JSON using the `json.Marshal` function.
And then, both map & struct are used again to parse the JSON using the `json.Unmarshal` function.

To run this program, use:
```bash
go run main.go
```
